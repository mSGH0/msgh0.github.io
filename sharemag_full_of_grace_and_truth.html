        <h6>By the end of this lesson, you should be able:</h6>
        <li>To understand the word of grace, the spirit of grace and the word of truth.</li>
        <li>To understand the role of the holy spirit in a believer's life as a spirit of truth.</li>
        <li>To understand the progression of the knowledge of christ.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
   
    <div>
      <h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Every individual who is alive is a word that has 
been made flesh. Whichever way you have 
come now is because you have given a 
particular flesh to a certain word that was 
released over you to go ahead of you.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Everything you do should be that you are giving 
a certain flesh to a certain word.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>
        When you do a qualitative analysis of Jesus, 
what you find is Grace and Truth that has put 
on flesh. When Jesus had to come as a man, 
the word that went ahead of Him was that He 
was to be the word of grace and the word of
truth.
      
      </p>
            
      <p>
        All that Jesus came to do on this earth is encompassed in these two words: the Word of Grace and the word of truth. Christ was the word, but the content of that word is the word of Grace and th word of truth. When Grace finds expression in a place,the Father is glorified in the Son.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        John 1:17 shows that the Word of Grace and the Word of Truth came through Jesus Christ. Truth is not simply because you say something that is contrary to a lie. One of the things a man encounters when he encounters the Word of Grace is sanctification.
      </p>

      <h6>The Word Of Grace - Salvation (Ephessians 2 : 5)</h6>
      
      <p>
        The word of Grace is what brought us salvation. Jesus had to come as the word of Grace so that our first encounter with Him would bring us into the place of salvation. The first grace we received is the grace that ushered us into salvation.
      </p>

      
      <h6>The Spirit Of Grace</h6>
      <p>
        This speaks of the convicting work of the Holy Spirit, convicting a man to accept and walk in the salvation he receives.
      </p>

      <p>
        Zechariah 12:10 speaks of the Spirit of grace categorically. In the New Testament we find a new word for the Spirit of Grace: the Comforter (the Holy Spirit).
      </p>

      <p>
        The Comforter is the One who helps us alongside; He is the enabling force who helps us accomplish the work of making the word we receive flesh- not by our own strength. When Grace came on earth, the Spirit came.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the dispensation of the Spirit of Grace, it is not about using our strength to accomplish the commandment of God (the personal commandment to you that needs the spirit of grace for you to put flesh to it).Hebrews 4:16
      </p>

      <h6>The Word Of Truth (John 17:17)</h6>
      
      <p>
        If it is truth, then it must be within the confines of the Word of God. Truth is not only limited to the commandments written in Scripture.
      </p>

      <p>
        We don't judge truth merely by what is scripted down, because there were many things Jesus wished to teach His disciples which were not written in the Bible.
      </p>         
      
      <p>
        The fact that something is true doesn't mean it is truth. Truth is only found in Christ. Truth is that which the Father embodies.If a man can find the reality of what the Father is made up of, then he has encountered truth.
      </p>
      
      <p>
         John 18:37 - Anything Jesus came to express of the Father is truth. Everything the Father is made up of is called truth. What Jesus testifies of the Father is truth, yet He is the embodiment of truth. When you have received Jesus by the spirit of grace, you have entered truth.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The realm of the Sonship of the Son is what we call Grace and Truth. After receiving salvation, you must grow, and we grow by receiving the word of His Grace.

      <p>
        1. The Spirit of Truth testifies of Jesus (John 15:26).
He bears witness of the one who is truth.
      </p>


      <p>
        2. The Spirit of Truth teaches us all things (John 14:26).

      <h3 id="memo3">The Progression Of The Knowlege Of Christ</h3>
      
       <p>
         a) GNOSIS 
         <p>General knowledge based on intellectual ability - 2 Peter 3:18. </p>
      </p>

      <p>
        b) GINOSKO
        <p>Revelation knowledge: complete knowledge delivered by the agency of the Spirit of God - 
Ephesians 3:14-19. Ginosko introduces a kind of knowledge not accessible to everyone; a knowledge not 
attained by the natural order of learning (body → soul → spirit).</p>
      </p>

      <p>
        c) EPIGINOSKO 
        <p>A state where knowledge unites with the knower. This is deeper revelation knowledge- 
fuller and intimate-granting connection and acquaintance with the knowledge itself, 
knowing all the details thereof - Colossians 1:6.</p>
        
      </p>
      
      <p>
        d) AÍDO / EIDO
        <p>Absolute knowledge that a man possesses. It is an awareness that cannot be argued away - 
a place of rest in the knowledge of Christ - 
Romans 8:28; 1 John 3:14.</p>
      </p>
      
      <p>
         e) EPIGNOSIS
        <p>The full, exact, comprehensive knowledge revealing the length, breadth, and height of the 
heart of God. It is revelation with participation - 
Philemon 1:6.</p>
      </p>
